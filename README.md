Quiz Gameplay: Users can start the quiz by clicking a start button, answer multiple-choice questions and progress through the quiz.

Timer: A timer starts when the quiz begins and users must answer questions within a time limit. Incorrect answers result in time deduction.

Local Storage: Users' scores and initials are saved locally, allowing them to persist between sessions and be displayed as high scores.

High Scores: Users can view the highest scores achieved by themselves and other players, providing a competitive aspect to the game.
